          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Viewing the chart with Age and Smokes selected, it looks like there is some correlation 
            between the two, but not very strong. The plots seem get higher for smokes percentage as 
            the median age per state rises. Utah being the lowest in both median age (30.5) and the 
            percent that smokes (9.7%). Where Maine has the highest median age (44.1), but is middle 
            of the pack for percentage that smoke (19.3%).
          </p>

          <p>Household Income and Obesity seem to have a stronger correlation. When they are selected 
            on the chart, the plots for obese percentage lower as the household income goes up. Mississippi, 
            West Virgina and Arkansas have the three highest obesity percentages and the also the three 
            lowest median household incomes. Maryland, New Jersey, Washington DC, and Alaska have the 
            highest median incomes and are significantly lower in obesity percentage.
          </p>

          <p>Poverty and Lack of Healthcare seem to also have a pretty stong correlation. The plots tend to 
            move up as the percentage in poverty and the pertcentage that lacks healthcare increase. Texas 
            has the highest percentage that lacks healthcare (24.9%) and is in the upper third for percentage 
            in poverty (17.2%).  New Hampshire has the lowest percentage in poverty (9.2%) and is in the lower 
            half for percentage that lacks healthcare (11.4%).</p>
